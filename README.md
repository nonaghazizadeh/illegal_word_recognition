# Illegal Word Recognition

In this endeavor, we aim to develop a mechanism capable of identifying altered illicit Persian words. While there are bots designed to detect such words, they often fail when extraneous characters are interspersed within the words. Our system, therefore, is designed to identify illicit words even when they are interspersed with non-Persian letters (including English letters), numbers, and special characters. 
Additionally, our system operates in two other modes. The first mode recognizes when the user inputs an abbreviation instead of the full word. The second mode identifies when the user employs contextually equivalent words.
